/**
 * Topic routing node.
 *
 * Classifies the user's question into a life area and returns the chart
 * factors that matter most for it, so Arya focuses on the right houses,
 * planets and Dashas instead of reading the whole chart every time.
 *
 * Keyword-based for now (instant, zero token cost, en/hi/mr). Swap
 * `classifyTopic` for an LLM classifier later if accuracy demands it —
 * the rest of the pipeline stays the same.
